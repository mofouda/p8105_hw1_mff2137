# Problem 1

## Data

I will use this code to load the `penguins` dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Description

The `penguins` dataset has 8 columns and 344 rows. Here’s a summary of
the the important variables and values in this dataset showing the names
and sums for species and island variables, the type, sum, and number of
NA’s for sex variable, and the minimum, 1st quantile, median, mean, 3rd
quantile, maximum, and number of NA’s respectively for the body mass
variable: species: 152, 68, 124, island: 168, 124, 52, body mass: 2700,
3550, 4050, 4201.754386, 4750, 6300, 2 , and sex: 165, 168, 11.

## Mean

I can take the mean of the flipper length. The mean is 200.92.

## Plot

I can make a scatterplot of the flipper length and bill length by
species.

# Problem 2

## New Dataframe

I can create a data frame using this **code chunk**

``` r
set.seed(20)
hw_df <- tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    vec_log = samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("y", "n", "m", "y", "m", "n", "n", "y", "y", "m"), 
                        levels = c("y", "n", "m"))
)
hw_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##      samp vec_log vec_char vec_factor
    ##     <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1  1.16  TRUE    1        y         
    ##  2 -0.586 FALSE   2        n         
    ##  3  1.79  TRUE    3        m         
    ##  4 -1.33  FALSE   4        y         
    ##  5 -0.447 FALSE   5        m         
    ##  6  0.570 TRUE    6        n         
    ##  7 -2.89  FALSE   7        n         
    ##  8 -0.869 FALSE   8        y         
    ##  9 -0.462 FALSE   9        y         
    ## 10 -0.556 FALSE   10       m

## Means

I can try to take the means of the variables in this data frame. The
mean of the random sample is -0.3623308. The mean of the logical vector
is 0.3. The mean of the character vector is NA. The mean of the factor
vector is NA. We notice that the means for the character vector and
factor vector returns as `NA` because their arguments are not numeric or
logical.

## Converting variables

I can convert the logical, character, and factor variables to numeric
using the following code:

``` r
set.seed(20)
hw_df <- tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    vec_log = as.numeric(samp > 0),
    vec_char = as.numeric(c("1", "2", "3", "4", "4", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10")),
    vec_factor = as.numeric(factor(c("y", "n", "m", "y", "m", "n", "n", "y", "y", "m"), 
                                   levels = c("y", "n", "m")))
)
```

Now we notice that we can get the means for all variables in the
dataset. The mean of the random sample is -0.36. The mean of the logical
vector is 0.3. The mean of the character vector is NA. The mean of the
factor vector is NA. This is because value for all variables are now
converted to numeric.
